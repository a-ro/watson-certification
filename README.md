Study Guide for Watson Certification

I made this guide to study before the Watson certification exam. I'm following this [guide](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/partnerworld/pub/certify/Study_Guide_C7020_230.pdf)  realeased by IBM which details the exam objectives. For each objective, I make my own answers and give some code examples when required. I wrote these answers in the markdown file of each section. Note that these answers are my own and have not been validated by IBM.

# Sections
- [Section 1 - Fundamentals of Cognitive Computing](https://github.com/a-ro/watson-certification/blob/master/section1/section1.md)
- [Section 3 - Fundamentals of IBM Watson Developer Cloud](https://github.com/a-ro/watson-certification/blob/master/section3/section3.md)
